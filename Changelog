* Ran cabal sandbox init and cabal installed the current zero dependencies
  * this creates a cabal.sandbox.config file, so we're gitignoring that now

---

* checked to ensure that most cabal commands work now
  * cabal configure
  * cabal build
  * cabal repl
  * cabal haddock
  * cabal check

* skeleton source file at src/System/Environment/Parser.hs
  * without this directory cabal will complain

* env-parser.cabal file configured to a good default state for any project
	* includes using the hs-source-dirs directive to pick the src dir
	* also includes a Haddock description (see ekmett/lens for hints here)
  * note that `cabal init` picks up Changelog and README.md as extra-source-files
  * note also that it fills out BSD3 licenses automatically but yells otherwise
  
* .gitignore file for ignoring cabal configuration noise

---

* Makefile with `make step` command
* Initial notes and writeup
* This file
